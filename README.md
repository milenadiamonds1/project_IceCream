The project implements an ice cream order form that includes selecting the size and flavor of the ice cream, as well as additional ingredients. Users can submit their order entered on the page using the "Order" button, and verify the entered data before submitting the form using validation.

The following technologies and programming languages were used in the project:

  HTML5
  CSS3
  JavaScript

  jQuery

The web application uses responsive design, allowing pages to be displayed correctly on different devices with varying screen resolutions.
